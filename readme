Forked to add XMP protocol, used in MySKY HD sat receivers/PVR by SKY Italia.
Actually, the remote is made by (or licenesed from) Universal Electroncis (http://www.uei.com), so the same protocol should work for many ohter devices (Comcast etc.).

I found interesting details about the XMP protocol on the JP1 project wiki: http://www.hifi-remote.com/wiki/index.php?title=DecodeIR#XMP

This is the IRremote library for the Arduino.

To download from github (http://github.com/shirriff/Arduino-IRremote), click on the "Downloads" link in the upper right, click "Download as zip", and get a zip file.  Unzip it and rename the directory shirriff-Arduino-IRremote-nnn to IRremote

To install, move the downloaded IRremote directory to:
arduino-1.x/libraries/IRremote
where arduino-1.x is your Arduino installation directory

After installation you should have files such as:
arduino-1.x/libraries/IRremote/IRremote.cpp

For details on the library see the Wiki on github or the blog post http://arcfn.com/2009/08/multi-protocol-infrared-remote-library.html
